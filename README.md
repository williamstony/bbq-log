# BBQ Log
Next.js app with ai routes for tracking BBQ cooks. I use it for all kinds of cooks but it is setup primarly for cooking BBQ on a smoker.

## Trying it out
1. clone this repo
2. cd into the directory
3. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and set your full MongoDB connection string as `MONGO_URL`
4. Run `yarn install`
5. After the install run `yarn dev`
6. By default the app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
